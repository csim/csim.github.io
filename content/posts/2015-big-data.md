I have noticed over the course of the last few months that each time I made an online purchase, miraculously advertisements for a related product appeared in my Facebook feed.
Once I didn’t even make a purchase on Amazon but only viewed the product — low and behold that exact product appeared in my Facebook feed.
I am not a conspiracy theorist or a privacy freak but this is getting a little creepy. It feels like there is a constant eye-in-the-sky watching my activities and making suggestions for the benefit of the all almighty economy.
Where is the line? When will the general public feel violated?
I remember a time when the general consensus said that we should not place any person information online including address and credit card numbers. That seems laughable now.
