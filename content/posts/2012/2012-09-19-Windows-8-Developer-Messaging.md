Bit of a rant here. I received this message today Microsoft.

Do you think the average developer knows that "Windows 8 GA" means?

GA stands for "Generally Availability". Put yourself in the position of the Microsoft marketer who composed this message. Why on Earth won't you just write out the words instead of using the abbreviation?

This doesn't need to be a secret handshake. Granted, if you [Google it on bing](http://www.collegehumor.com/video/5072264/googling-with-bing), you'll get an answer fairly quickly. But really?!? Do we need to be put through this?

Microsoft -- just type it out next time.
