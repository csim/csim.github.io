Managing a product is hard. Ideas come from all angles, many of them have merit
and worst of all you do not generally have enough direct feedback to make an
informed decision about which ideas carry the most value.

There is an inherit danger in committing resources toward too many features.
Time is finite and the team is small. Picking the wrong features means
potentially confusing users or failing to attract users in the first place.

The worst part is that picking the wrong features means that you are also not
working on the features that users need, compounding the problem by way of
temporarily hijacking development time and diluting the product like a bad
domestic beer. Not to mention, the more you build, the more things will break
forcing you into a perpetual spiral of pain.

Instead, I strive to keep the product simple at all costs, launch only what is
necessary and evolve to complexity over time. As the saying goes, Rome was not
built in a day and they did not have to hundreds of users to deal with in real
time.

Remember, deciding to add the wrong feature is the gift that keeps on give
giving.
