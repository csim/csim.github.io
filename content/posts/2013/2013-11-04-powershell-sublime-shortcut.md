Lately I have been learning about [Git](http://git-scm.org) and [GitHub](http://github.com). Most of this work is done at the command line, I have found myself quickly amassing PowerShell functions that acts as shortcuts.

One very handy shortcut is the ability to launch the [sublime text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com) and open the current directory as a project. Or alternately passing in a file to edit.

Once this function is in your powershell profile, just type "edit" at the command prompt and sublime will open the current folder.
