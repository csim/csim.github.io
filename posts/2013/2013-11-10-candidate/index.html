<h2 id=must-have>Must have</h2>
<p><em>Experience.</em> Nothing trumps experience. The more times you are &ldquo;at-bat&rdquo;, the more lessons you learn. Particularly experience at progressively higher of levels responsibility is desirable. Challenging yourself is ultimately the only way to grow and learn.</p>
<p><em>Technology aptitude.</em> I don&rsquo;t necessarily mean reciting minute technical details from memory. I mean <em>understanding</em> the underlying principles of technology. Abstraction, service oriented architecture, componentization, dependency injection, user experience design. Deep understand of these topics are what separates the great consultants from the rest.</p>
<p><em>Consulting IQ.</em> Soft skills are where we make our money. Reading a room, understanding the motivations involved, working toward a common goal while avoiding or minimizing conflicts. These are things that a consultant does every day. It is hard to judge this quality</p>
<p><em>Confidence.</em> Nothing sells a candidate like the combination of confidence <em>and skills</em>. When someone is comfortable in their own skin, everyone around them can also be at easy with any situation. Usually confidence comes from a solid history of delivery experience and the understanding that the candidate can overcome any impediments to success.</p>
<p><em>Inquisitive nature.</em> Every single person on this planet should be constantly asking questions and learning. If the candidate is not asking questions (and hopefully intelligent questions), how can I hope to send that person into an unknown client situation and expect good results?</p>
<p><em>Personality and likability.</em> Ultimately our clients are people and people form relationships with others and those relationships affect important decisions. Likability goes a long way toward forging relationships. Simple things, like mentioning a hobby or sharing a laugh about some common interest can add up to extremely valuable relationships over time. Some of this comes from simply liking what you do for a living, but I think mostly it comes from a positive outlook.</p>
<p><em>Honesty.</em> Look, I know that things go sideways on projects. In fact, I would venture to say that every single project has a &ldquo;sideways&rdquo; phase at some point in the process. An honest candidate will talk intelligently about these situations and recognize that we do a difficult job and sometimes things don&rsquo;t work out as expected.</p>
<h2 id=deal-breakers>Deal breakers</h2>
<p><em>Candidate is too nervous to talk.</em> It&rsquo;s sad to say but if a candidate is too nervous to speak in an interview, there is no way that he will be able to meet with a client in unfamiliar environment. I usually go out of my way to have some small talk at the start of the interview, just to set the tone and send a message that I am approachable and we are going to have a pleasant conversation.</p>
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t hear excitement.</em> It&rsquo;s a job interview. Tell me why you are excited about this job. What you want to accomplish in your career and how you feel about seizing this opportunity. At a bare minimum, win me over with enthusiasm. Sometimes I will take someone who is excited and will work really hard over someone who has more skill.</p>

<h2 class=post-card-title>PowerShell Sublime Text Shortcut</h2>
</header>
<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>Lately I have been learning about Git and GitHub. Most of this work is done at the command line, I have found myself quickly amassing PowerShell functions that acts as shortcuts.
One very handy shortcut is the ability to launch the sublime text editor and open the current directory as a project. Or alternately passing in a file to edit.
Once this function is in your powershell profile, just type &ldquo;edit&rdquo; at the command prompt and sublime will open the current folder.</p>

<h2 class=post-card-title>Keyboard Manual Registry Settings</h2>
</header>
<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>I have always had a sneaking suspicion that my keyboard repeat rate and repeat delay settings were a little too slow for my taste. Windows only lets to you increase the values in a fixed range but with a registry change, you can adjust as you please.
Play around with AutoRepeatDelay and AutoRepeatRate, these are the settings that work for me.
Don&rsquo;t set the AutoRepeatDelay too fast, it will make it so that when you type letters they are repeated immediately.</p>
