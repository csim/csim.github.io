<blockquote>
<p>The attacks resulted in the death of 2,996 people, including the 19 hijackers and 2,977 victims. The victims included 246 on the four planes (from which there were no survivors), 2,606 in New York City in the towers and on the ground, and 125 at the Pentagon. Nearly all of the victims were civilians; 55 military personnel were among those killed at the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Another article bashing Windows 8 and the Microsoft strategy around it. It seems that because of Apple&rsquo;s success, Microsoft is in a no-win situation according to the pundits.</p>
<p>Personally I quite like Windows 8 and I think it will most certainly have an impact. There is no doubt that Microsoft is behind the innovation curve, but Windows 8 is a step in the right direction. Time will tell if Microsoft can capture the rapidly merging business and consumer IT space. First and foremost Windows 8 needs apps, and lots of them.</p>

<p>Deep explanation of the Heisenberg principle and the efforts of a team of graduate student to disprove the theory. You might think that this is in the theoretical physics realm, but actually <a href=http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html>God plays dice</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we are seeing is Microsoft power brokers asleep at the helm, specifically their evangelism is dead and lastly their messaging around the transition for Silverlight/WPF has been fumbled to the point where its easy now to believe Microsoft has hit &ldquo;Shift+Delete&rdquo; on these two products than it is to read the above (to much carnage on the roadmap now).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If Microsoft had of come out and said something to the effect - &ldquo;Look you asked us to fix WPF and Silverlight. We did that, we came up with a way now that lets you develop for our platform in three ways. The first is C++ if you want deeper access to Windows then we&rsquo;ve tided up our Com++ API&rsquo;s to a way that C# developers have found palatable. If you don&rsquo;t want to do native code then you can build applications like you have done with SilverLight in the past but the difference is it will now only be Windows only (sorry). If you then want to build apps that are cross-platform then again we&rsquo;ve got HTML5 and Internet Explorer story brewing whilst its important to understand that we will not be looking to expand our developer story beyond Windows anymore (there is a certain amount of control HTML5 will give but we still believe Internet Explorer is a better bet overall).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting rundown delivered from a Windows 8 platform insider.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly that Windows 8 doesn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s fast and, from my still-limited experience, stable. Programs, once open, run well. The major issues are twofold: first, Microsoft has inserted several extra steps into the process of performing basic functions like &ldquo;launching a program&rdquo; or &ldquo;shutting down the system.&rdquo; Second, the parallel tracks of the &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; and Desktop environments give it what feels like a split personality. The overall result makes it challenging to navigate smoothly, and will likely frustrate many gamers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frank recap and opinion. It is obvious that software and hardware is becoming more specialized and traditional outlets (PCs and phones) are more squarely focused on casual gaming.</p>
<p>Valve is correctly recognizing this and guiding their business accordingly. This is not the fault of Windows 8 but an industry trend. I just don&rsquo;t see the conflict with Windows 8 directly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in 25 years, Microsoft is changing its corporate logo.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft, which has used its solid, boldfaced, italicized logo since 1987, is expected to unveil its new, more colorful logo Thursday at the Boston opening of the 23rd Microsoft store. It will also appear Thursday at the Seattle and Bellevue Microsoft stores, as well as on the Microsoft.com home page.</p>

<p>My Favorite Features: Entity Framework Code First and ASP.NET Web API Great overview of the EF5 release with summary and coding samples.
Jason Zander:
New features in Entity Framework 5:
Enum support is a long awaited feature for EF and allows you to have enum properties in your domain classes. EF5 makes enum support available in the EF Designer and Code First. Table-valued functions in an existing database can now be included in models that are created using the EF Designer.</p>

<p>Windows 8: The Boldest, Biggest Redesign In Microsoft&rsquo;s History Fast company with a mostly positive article on Windows 8. Refreshing.
The iPhone 5 Is Completely Amazing and Utterly Boring I could not agree more. As Louis CK would say &ndash; Everything is amazing and nobody is happy.
The power of ignoring mainstream news When I first started ignoring news, I felt that I was simply making an excuse, that if I had more time I should read the news.</p>
