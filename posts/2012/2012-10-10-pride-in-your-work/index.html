<p>In my daily work, I lead teams that build software. These are &ldquo;line of business&rdquo; or &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; software systems. I come into contact with a lot of developers, all with differing backgrounds, experience levels and personalities. I see the good and the bad. Pride generally stands out as the most accurate quality indicator of the individual developer.</p>
<p>Having pride in your work makes you want to improve. If you are mindful of the effects that your work has on others, that can only lead to a better career path. First, you need to be self-aware and able to see your work through the eyes of a co-worker. Then you need to have the foresight to adjust your behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>Ask your self these questions, they all show pride in your work:</p>
<h3 id=how-can-i-communicate-more-effectively-with-the-team>How can I communicate more effectively with the team?</h3>
<p>Be clear and concise. Don&rsquo;t ramble. Stay on topic, avoid distractions. Drive the conversation forward. Don&rsquo;t speak if you have nothing to say. When you speak, add value. Listen. Yield to the experts. Challenge but don&rsquo;t create conflict. Keep everything on a business level. Take time understand context. Provide context.</p>
<h3 id=how-can-i-make-my-self-more-valuable-to-the-team>How can I make my self more valuable to the team?</h3>
<p>Follow through on your commitments. Don&rsquo;t get in over your head. Mentor others. Give constructive feedback. Call out issues early. Be proactive. Always give 100%. Be consistent. Take ownership. Take responsibility for mistakes.</p>
<h3 id=what-can-i-do-to-help-others-more-easily-discover-the-design-of-this-component>What can I do to help others more easily discover the design of this component?</h3>
<p>Use descriptive variable names (even on private / local members). Add comments to code that is not obviously understood. Use the built-in documentation conventions of your language. Name classes, properties and methods in a <em>logical and consistent</em> way.</p>
<p>All of this ultimately forms your reputation as a developer. All you have is your reputation. I have moved jobs a fews times in my career and I can tell you that having a network of people who are aware of your capabilities is the best possible resource when it&rsquo;s time for job hunting.</p>

</header>
<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>Ever since I can remember I have been an addict. Over the years my addictions have come and gone. But one thing has always remained: I have an addictive personality. Luckily for me all my addictions have been mostly productive.
It started when I got my first computer, the Commodore 64. At the age of 10 I got the C64 for Christmas and soon after I learned the BASIC programming language so that I could study my Spanish vocabulary words.</p>

</header>
<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>&ldquo;The Clock Problem&rdquo; is an interview question that I have been using for a few years. I first learned about it when I was being interviewed. I have now adopted it as my first line of defense against imposters. :)
It&rsquo;s a simple problem that can be used to determine a candidate&rsquo;s capacity for analytical problem solving. The beauty is that the problem has a simple and elegant solution which can be found in less than 10 minutes.</p>
