<p>It&rsquo;s funny, I put off writing this post for over a week. That might make me a hypocrite but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that the truth is less important. Procrastination is the enemy.</p>
<p>If you want to get something done, start immediately and <a href=http://www.economist.com/node/18557776>fail often</a>.</p>
<p>There are a million reasons not to start right away. Maybe you won&rsquo;t be any good at it, or you have more important things to do. Maybe you are just plain scared of judgment from your peers.</p>
<p>The truth is that starting a task is the most important step to finishing a task. If it&rsquo;s something simple then just knock it out quickly. If it&rsquo;s a more complicated task, then engaging your mind is the pathway to completion. Engaging your mind on a particular task acts like a channel, forcing thoughts to form around a central idea. Once your mind is engaged in problem solving there is a very low chance that you will slip on into procrastination.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this. When there is a hard problem that I can&rsquo;t seem to solve with conventional methods, I sometimes allow myself to completely forget about the topic altogether. This is not procrastination but rather a way to utilize my sub-conscious mind. My letting the topic ferment in the deep recesses of my mind I can afford</p>

<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>You have been working here for about 3 years. Life is good. You come in as late as you like and leave late because the work is challenging and rewarding. No one is watching over your shoulder, most days you sling code until your mind goes numb. At any moment a nerf gun war can break out in the office. When Halo 3 was released, all work stopped and there was an all-nighter in the game room.</p>

</header>
<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>One of the best things that you can do as a developer is to be equal parts lazy and smart. This is an art that can be mastered to great effect. I don&rsquo;t mean that you should abandon your passion for programming or stop being focused and goal driven. I mean that you should avoid work that is not absolutely necessary. To do that you need to be both lazy and smart in equal parts.</p>
