<p>When creating custom controls it is often must easier to create a control using
the &ldquo;User Control&rdquo; development model instead of the &ldquo;Server Control&rdquo; model. <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zt27tfhy.aspx>Server controls</a> generally have a more &ldquo;low level&rdquo; feel and dictate that the developer build the control&rsquo;s rendering from scratch. Either by building a control tree or by constructing the rendered output in code.</p>
<p>Alternatively <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y6wb1a0e.aspx>user controls</a> have nice separation of code and presentation by virtue of having a markup file (.ascx) and a code behind file; much like a standard aspx page. User controls can be created and developed using the same standard approaches and processes that we all know and love from the aspx page model.</p>
<p>When implementing a custom field control for SharePoint, the development experience can be streamlined to a large degree by utilizing a user control. Traditionally field controls are created using the server control model but with a few tricks you can implement a custom field control with a user control.</p>
<p>First, here is the base class used for the field control. It has a virtual property used to set the user control path. A property override for the value of the field which is read from the user control. On initialization it loads the user control and sets the context.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example field control subclass. This class simply specifies the user control path and let&rsquo;s the base class handle all the details of loading the user control and setting the context. This is the server control that you will embed into you page layouts.</p>
<p>Next, is the abstract base class for the user control. This class provides a property for a reference to the parent field control and an abstract property for the field value. The field control property is important because our user control will need to know all the information about the field it is attached to. This includes the SPField context and control mode among other things.</p>
<p>Lastly you can create a user control that inherits from the SPFieldUserControlBase class and implement the specific UI that is necessary for you field control to function. See my pervious post on how to create a custom field control for further direction on creating field controls from scratch.
This technique also you to have easiest possible development process while leveraging the SharePoint field control infrastructure. Any questions or comments, please let me know!</p>

<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>As SharePoint becomes more prevalent in the custom application development realm, there has been some friction and malcontent expressed in relation to deployment processes, team development methods and application upgrade paths. I believe that Microsoft has fallen short on providing the tools necessary to promote and support custom application development on the SharePoint platform.
In my opinion, the SharePoint platform should not limit nor impede my ability as a custom application developer to deliver solutions that follow the same deployment principals as any other custom asp.</p>

<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>You are probably familiar with the fact that SharePoint now has the capability to host site with anonymous access turned on. I learned the hard way that item level permissions do not participate in the anonymous access behavior the way you might expect. When an item does not inherit permissions, it is not possible to enable anonymous access on that item. Note the document library permission settings menu:
Here&rsquo;s the same menu for an item which is not inheriting permissions from the parent library:</p>
