<p>Over the years I have come across software consulting companies in various states. It occurs to me that there must be a finite set of categories that defines the culture of a consultancy. Here&rsquo;s a few that I have recognized.</p>
<p><strong>The oak tree.</strong> This company is rock solid and has been that way for many years. After establishing itself initially, stable but modest growth has lead to a consistency over time. To be successful at this company, you must deeply agree with the culture and value system. This can be a great place to have a long tenure and create long term professional relationship. Rebels and change agents need not apply.</p>
<p><strong>The Butterfly.</strong> This company is always morphing into something new. Things that are important today may have less valuable in the future. Hot and cold streaks plague the company&rsquo;s history. Take a job here only if you think that the experience you will gain out weighs the risk of a left turn when you least expect it. Often very few people know when the left turn is coming.</p>
<p><strong>The junkyard dog.</strong> This company will do anything to keep busy and stay in business. Web site? Mobile? ASP.NET? LAMP? Yep they do that. Take a job here if you want to be a jack of all trades. These are usually good resume builders and companies where you can figure out what technologies you are most passionate about. The downside can be randomization and lack of direction, usually the technology leadership is not necessarily that deeply technical because it is very difficult to be deep in all technologies.</p>
<p><strong>The Corporation.</strong> They are Enterprise. They are monumental. They will put a complex plan into place and deliver solid results on time and on budget through deliberate and consistent execution. You&rsquo;ll excel here if you enjoy structure and thrive when things are planned out to microscopic detail. Here&rsquo;s to &ldquo;synergy&rdquo;!</p>

</header>
<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>Spotify launched in the U.S. on July 14th. Given the hoopla around the service I decided to give it a try. Spotify is a music service that allows users to stream or download music, includes social integration and has support for offline listening. Many people have raved about the service in Europe and there has been a constant chorus for an american launch.
After 5 days of use, here&rsquo;s my impressions:</p>

<h2 class=post-card-title>Google's new App Engine pricing</h2>
</header>
<section class=post-card-excerpt>
<p>Google App engine is in the process of changing it&rsquo;s pricing model. At present this new pricing model goes into effect on December 1, 2011. There has been quite an uproar among App engine developers. In some cases the new billing model raises monthly costs by more than 300%. This has cause quite a reaction among the community and the backlash is very real
What is changing? The primary change is that Google is moving from a model where you are charged by CPU time to a model where you are charged by &ldquo;instance time&rdquo;.</p>
