Windows only lets to you increase the values in a fixed range but with a registry change, you can adjust as you please.
Play around with AutoRepeatDelay and AutoRepeatRate, these are the settings that work for me.
Don&amp;rsquo;t set the AutoRepeatDelay too fast, it will make it so that when you type letters they are repeated immediately.</description></item></channel></rss>
