I got pneumonia and spent 3 days in the hospital. After recovering, I knew that I needed to get fit and running seemed like a good idea. I started to run regularly, not really thinking that I would get involved in long distance competitive running.
A few months later, I was running 20+ miles a week. I began to think that I may want to do some races in the area, just for fun.</description></item></channel></rss>
