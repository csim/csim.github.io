I received this message today Microsoft.
Do you think the average developer knows that &amp;ldquo;Windows 8 GA&amp;rdquo; means?
GA stands for &amp;ldquo;Generally Availability&amp;rdquo;. Put yourself in the position of the Microsoft marketer who composed this message. Why on Earth won&amp;rsquo;t you just write out the words instead of using the abbreviation?
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be a secret handshake. Granted, if you Google it on bing, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an answer fairly quickly.</description></item><item><title>A Month with Windows 8</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2012/2012-09-17-a-month-with-windows-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2012/2012-09-17-a-month-with-windows-8/</guid><description>I got my hands on a copy of Windows 8 through MSDN about a month ago and installed it immediately. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it since then as my daily working machine on my main laptop.
First of all the speed of Windows 8 is apparent from the start. Everything feels faster - boot time, application launch, etc. I am working on a 3 year old Lenovo W500 and I can honestly say that Windows 8 has extended its life by at least 6 months.</description></item></channel></rss>
