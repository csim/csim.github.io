Ideas come from all angles, many of them have merit and worst of all you don’t generally have enough direct feedback to make an informed decision about which ideas carry the most value.
There is an inherit danger in committing resources toward too many features. Time is finite and the team is small. Picking the wrong features means potentially confusing users or failing to attract users in the first place.</description></item><item><title>MongoDB .Net Driver date handling</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2015/2015-07-27-mongodb-date-handling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2015 08:23:36 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2015/2015-07-27-mongodb-date-handling/</guid><description>I ran into an interesting situation when saving dated to MongoDB using the Mongo .Net driver (version 2.0).
When saving a date with unspecified kind, the driver converts the date to a universal datetime. It appears that the driver will assume that a DateTime object with an unspecified kind is a local time, and convert it to universal time (UTC) before committing it to the database.
In my particular case, my origin date was UTC and was read from SQL server.</description></item><item><title>Dropzone knockout binding</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2014/2014-10-17-dropzone-knockout-binding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2014 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2014/2014-10-17-dropzone-knockout-binding/</guid><description>A very simple knockout binding for dropzone.</description></item><item><title>Data Migration is Hard</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2013/2013-08-06-data-migration-is-hard/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2014 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2013/2013-08-06-data-migration-is-hard/</guid><description>Data migration can sink your project. It lurks around the edges of your estimation model, hiding deep dark secrets that will only be uncovered at the very end of the project. Nothing could be worse. Discovering that you need to increase the migration schedule 5 fold at the 11th hour can not only derail your project but if it happens too often it might derail your career.

Don&amp;rsquo;t set the AutoRepeatDelay too fast, it will make it so that when you type letters they are repeated immediately.</description></item><item><title>What I look for in a Candidate</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2013/2013-11-10-candidate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2013 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2013/2013-11-10-candidate/</guid><description>Must have Experience.

In fact, it downright does not work with IE10. Many of the web dialogs are unusable and when you receive an error, the error dialog exhibits bazaar behavior.
This is an absolute tragedy. Windows 8 launched 3 weeks ago with IE10 included and the Dynamics product team was not prepared.

This is an art that can be mastered to great effect. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that you should abandon your passion for programming or stop being focused and goal driven.

What is changing? The primary change is that Google is moving from a model where you are charged by CPU time to a model where you are charged by &amp;ldquo;instance time&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Types of consultancies and how to pick one</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-07-21-types-of-consultancies-and-how-to-pick-one/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2011 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-07-21-types-of-consultancies-and-how-to-pick-one/</guid><description>Over the years I have come across software consulting companies in various states. It occurs to me that there must be a finite set of categories that defines the culture of a consultancy. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few that I have recognized.
The oak tree. This company is rock solid and has been that way for many years. After establishing itself initially, stable but modest growth has lead to a consistency over time.</description></item><item><title>Spotify First impressions</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-07-19-spotify-first-imperessions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2011 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-07-19-spotify-first-imperessions/</guid><description>Spotify launched in the U.S. on July 14th. Given the hoopla around the service I decided to give it a try. Spotify is a music service that allows users to stream or download music, includes social integration and has support for offline listening. Many people have raved about the service in Europe and there has been a constant chorus for an american launch.
After 5 days of use, here&amp;rsquo;s my impressions:</description></item><item><title>First Marathon Complete</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-07-01-first-marathon-complete/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-07-01-first-marathon-complete/</guid><description>My marathon journey started in the summer of 2009. I got pneumonia and spent 3 days in the hospital. After recovering, I knew that I needed to get fit and running seemed like a good idea. I started to run regularly, not really thinking that I would get involved in long distance competitive running.
A few months later, I was running 20+ miles a week. I began to think that I may want to do some races in the area, just for fun.</description></item><item><title>How to get started with OData</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-06-06-how-to-get-started-with-odata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2011 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-06-06-how-to-get-started-with-odata/</guid><description>Open data protocol or OData is a new Microsoft technology standard which allows for simple data exchange over a REST style interface. The idea is to create a web based interface for complex data stores and in the process free data from silos. This will in theory create a data utopia complete with bunnies, fairies and a side of mash potatoes.
There are a couple of intriguing facets to this proposition.</description></item><item><title>5 things you should do when estimating a technology project</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-03-04-5-things-you-should-do-when-a-technology-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2011 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-03-04-5-things-you-should-do-when-a-technology-project/</guid><description>Estimating a project can be one of the hardest things you do as a technology consultant. Over the years I have done my share of estimation and one thing has become clear to me. Estimation accurately is almost impossible. With lots of experience and some hard knocks, you can accumulate the courage necessary to throw down an estimate. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few tips that I think might help.

Somehow in this crazy house that I live in, ago a week ago, my guitar spontaneously migrated out of my office. One of the kids moved it to the upstairs bonus room without my knowledge. I usually keep my acoustic guitar right next to my work desk. It sits there 99 percent of the time. Occasionally when the mode strikes, I pick it up and strum a tune.</description></item><item><title>Code is Creative</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-02-14-code-is-creative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2011 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2011/2011-02-14-code-is-creative/</guid><description>Most people think of programmers as the guys guzzling mountain dew in a dark room where pizza slides under the door at around 6PM and a feature is built by 2AM. Although this is can be the case (we&amp;rsquo;ve all been there), I have found that most of the people that I look up to are not at all like this. More often than not people who have influenced me over the years are people that show a genuine passion for software but also have massive creative energy and a social team mentality to boot.</description></item><item><title>Using the SharePoint content database as a cache</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2008/2008-09-12-using-the-sharepoint-content-database-as-a-cache/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2008 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2008/2008-09-12-using-the-sharepoint-content-database-as-a-cache/</guid><description>Data caching is a core concept in the web dominated world that we live in. The premise is that we should not have to go back to retrieve data from a data store for every single web request when the data is unchanged, thereby sharing data across web requests. This offers huge performance advantages because all latency related to data fetching, query processing and transmission is eliminated for requests that use the same data.</description></item><item><title>Customize the web.config with a SharePoint XML customization</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2008/2008-08-16-customize-the-web.config-with-a-sharepoint-customization/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2008 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2008/2008-08-16-customize-the-web.config-with-a-sharepoint-customization/</guid><description>It is possible to manipulate the web.config file globally by using a little known feature in SharePoint that allows developers to describe a set of changes by using an XML customization file. In fact, both SharePoint and MOSS use this mechanism to publish web.config changes when a web application is created.

I learned the hard way that item level permissions do not participate in the anonymous access behavior the way you might expect. When an item does not inherit permissions, it is not possible to enable anonymous access on that item. Note the document library permission settings menu:
Here&amp;rsquo;s the same menu for an item which is not inheriting permissions from the parent library:</description></item><item><title>Custom Field control implemented as a User Control</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2008/2008-03-13-custom-field-control-implemented-as-a-user-control/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2008 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2008/2008-03-13-custom-field-control-implemented-as-a-user-control/</guid><description>When creating custom controls it is often must easier to create a control using the &amp;ldquo;User Control&amp;rdquo; development model instead of the &amp;ldquo;Server Control&amp;rdquo; model. Server controls generally have a more &amp;ldquo;low level&amp;rdquo; feel and dictate that the developer build the control&amp;rsquo;s rendering from scratch. Either by building a control tree or by constructing the rendered output in code.
Alternatively user controls have nice separation of code and presentation by virtue of having a markup file (.</description></item><item><title>SharePoint Custom Application Development Methodologies</title><link>https://csim.github.io/posts/2008/2008-01-07-sharepoint-custom-application-development-methodologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2008 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/posts/2008/2008-01-07-sharepoint-custom-application-development-methodologies/</guid><description>As SharePoint becomes more prevalent in the custom application development realm, there has been some friction and malcontent expressed in relation to deployment processes, team development methods and application upgrade paths. I believe that Microsoft has fallen short on providing the tools necessary to promote and support custom application development on the SharePoint platform.
In my opinion, the SharePoint platform should not limit nor impede my ability as a custom application developer to deliver solutions that follow the same deployment principals as any other custom asp.</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://csim.github.io/pages/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csim.github.io/pages/about/</guid><description>Hi, I am Clint.
